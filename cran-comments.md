## awsjavasdk 0.2.2 Release

This release extends the timeout to download the SDK (and makes the timeout user configurable).  I also add some warnings that the package isn't being actively used and suggest to interactive users of the package a couple other packages they might want to switch to.  This submission is late, so awsjavasdk is currently removed/archived.
