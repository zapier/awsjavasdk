Description: Provides boilerplate access to all of the classes included in the 
    Amazon Web Services ('AWS') Java Software Development Kit (SDK) via 
    package:'rJava'.  According to Amazon, the 'SDK helps take the complexity 
    out of coding by providing Java APIs for many AWS services including 
    Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, DynamoDB, and more'.  You can read more about the 
    included Java code on Amazon's website: 
    <https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/>.
